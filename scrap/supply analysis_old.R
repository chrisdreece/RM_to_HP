### where are we losing demand because an assignment is not allocated?
  ### are there Employees in assignments who don't show up in active? 
  ### only 1:
missingEmps <- assignments %>%
  filter(!(EmployeeID %in% unique(employees$EmployeeID)))

  ### how about the assignments that haven't been allocated?
